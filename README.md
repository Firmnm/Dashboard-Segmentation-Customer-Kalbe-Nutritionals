Customer Segmentation Dashboard for Kalbe Nutritionals

This repository contains the project for building a Customer Segmentation Dashboard as part of the Data Scientist Project-Based Internship at Kalbe Nutritionals. The goal of this project is to segment customers based on their behavior and demographics to support targeted marketing strategies and enhance customer engagement.

Project Overview
In this project, I applied K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer groups from the available dataset. The dashboard visualizes these segments, allowing stakeholders to explore customer behavior and patterns interactively.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the raw dataset for analysis.
Clustering: Implementing K-Means clustering to segment customers into meaningful groups.
Interactive Dashboard: Built using Python and Tableau, allowing users to explore the segmentation results and insights.
Insights: The dashboard provides valuable insights into customer behavior, helping to optimize marketing strategies.
Tech Stack:
Python: Used for data processing, analysis, and clustering implementation.
Tableau: For building an interactive and user-friendly dashboard.
Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and processing.
Scikit-learn: To implement the K-Means clustering algorithm.
